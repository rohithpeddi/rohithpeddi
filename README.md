# 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Ph.D. student in Computer Science** at the **University of Texas at Dallas**, under the guidance of [Dr. Vibhav Gogate](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vibhav.gogate/) and [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/). Before starting my Ph.D., I earned my undergraduate degree from **IIT Kharagpur** and worked as an **R&D Engineer** at **Next Education India Pvt Ltd.** and **ZeMoSo Labs Pvt Ltd.** 

## 🧩 Research Focus

My research focuses on developing algorithms that enable machines to understand human interactions in a **data-efficient manner**

1. **🎥 Accurate Interpretation of Human Interactions**  
   By integrating multiple data modalities—vision, text, and audio—I aim to answer the **_what_** of observed interactions.  
   - Tackling challenges in robust learning  
   - Addressing issues in long-tailed recognition  

2. **🔮 Anticipation of Human Interactions**  
   Exploring the **_why_** behind actions to enhance AI systems' ability to anticipate future interactions.  
   - Leveraging underlying priors for predictive AI behaviour  

3. **🤖 Transfer of Observed Interactions to Robots**  
   Adapting observed human interactions to specific robotic embodiments.  
   - Enabling robots to interpret, understand, and replicate human interactions effectively
